# Data Privacy Policy for WorkSmarter

### Effective Date: June 5, 2023

Thank you for using the "Work Smarter" Chrome extension ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you interact with our Extension. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information. By using the Extension, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect:

The Extension collects the following types of information:

a. Scripting: The Extension may utilize scripting to interact with websites and enhance user experience.

b. Tabs: The Extension may access and manage tabs in your browser to perform certain tasks or display relevant information.

## Use of Information:

When a user gives a domain of a website to block and the timer is on, we are using the data from your Chrome web browser to block the content of the website if it is one of the domains the user supplied. The extension uses data to know when a user changes tabs and changes websites of your current active tab to check if it is a domain given by the user. The chrome extension will never block any content from a domain that is not given by the user. Once the timer is off, the blocked domains that the user gave will be free to use. Our extension does not store any of the data that is being tracked at all. We do not transfer any data to any 3rd party servers.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy:

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy within the Extension or by other means of communication. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.

## Contact Us:

If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at sotoruiz.emmanuel@gmail.com or at https://mannysotoruiz.com/index.html#contact.

By continuing to use the Extension, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.
